# Physical Layer & Basis of Data Communication

Physical Layer is the foundation on which other layers are built
- Properties of wires, fiber, wireless affect the networks limitations.
- It determines **throughput, latency,** and **error rate** of a network communication link.
- **KEY PROBLEM** Sending Digital Bits, using only Analog Signals, called *Modulation*
    - Voltage, Current, Frequency and Phase are general properties that need consideration

- **Bandwidth** In Analog, it's a Quantity measured in **Hertz** (Hz), In the discrete Digital world, we recognize it as a Data-rate of **bps**

## Guided Transmission Media vs. Unguided

**Guided**
- Copper Wires, Twisted Pairs, Coaxial Cables, etc..

Twisted-Pair (Cat 5,6,7) Reduce Noise in Data
