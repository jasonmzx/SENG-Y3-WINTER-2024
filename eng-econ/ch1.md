### Interest Rate & Return
- *Interest* is **paid** when a person or organization borrowed money *(obtained a loan)* and repays a larger amount over time. 
- *Interest* is **earned** when a person or organization saved, invested, or lent money and obtains a return of a larger
amount over time. 

**Principal** = The money that you originally agreed to pay back.

`Interest = Amount Owed Now - Principal`

**AT** = Interest Accured per Time Unit.

`Interest Rate (%) = AT / Principal * 100%`
