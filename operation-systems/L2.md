## Operation System Services:

1. **Communications**: Processes exchange information either within the same system or across networked computers. This is achieved through shared memory or message passing.

2. **Error Detection**: The OS constantly monitors and corrects errors in the CPU, memory, I/O devices, and user programs. Actions vary from halting the system to process termination or error reporting.

3. **Resource Allocation**: The OS allocates resources like CPU cycles, memory, and I/O devices to multiple concurrent processes. Allocation strategies consider factors like CPU speed, process needs, and peripheral device management.

4. **Logging**: Tracks resource usage by programs for billing or usage statistics. Helps system administrators in system reconfiguration for improved services.

5. **Protection and Security**: Involves controlling access to system resources and preventing process interference. Security measures include user authentication and defending against external access, especially in networked environments.
