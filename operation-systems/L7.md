## Deadlock Ordering

```c
void transaction(Account from, Account to, double amount){
    
    mutex_t lock1, lock2;
    
    lock1 = get_lock(from);
    lock2 = get_lock(to);
    
    acquire(lock1);
    
        acquire(lock2);
    
            withdraw(from, amount);
            deposit(to, amount);
    
        release(lock2);
    
    release(lock1);
}
```

1. **Transaction 1** (`transaction(checking_account, savings_account, 25)`):
   - **Thread 1** acquires `lock1` for the checking account.
   - **Thread 1** then attempts to acquire `lock2` for the savings account.

2. **Transaction 2** (`transaction(savings_account, checking_account, 50)`):
   - **Thread 2** acquires `lock1` (which is now `lock2` in Transaction 1’s context) for the savings account.
   - **Thread 2** then attempts to acquire `lock2` (which is `lock1` in Transaction 1’s context) for the checking account.

3. **Waiting on Each Other**:
   - **Thread 1** is waiting for **Thread 2** to release the lock on the savings account.
   - **Thread 2** is waiting for **Thread 1** to release the lock on the checking account.

This situation is a classic deadlock where each thread is holding a resource needed by the other thread and is waiting for the other resource to become available, which never happens because both are indefinitely waiting.

## Solution:

**Lock 3** must be acquired before locks 1 & 2.

```c
void transaction(Account from, Account to, double amount){
    
    mutex_t lock1, lock2, lock3;
    
    acquire(lock3); //"Master Lock" for Whole Transaction

    lock1 = get_lock(from);
    lock2 = get_lock(to);
    
    acquire(lock1);
    
        acquire(lock2);
    
            withdraw(from, amount);
            deposit(to, amount);

        //Done with the Critical Section:
        release(lock3);

        release(lock2);
    
    release(lock1);
}
```

* By Releasing Lock 3 Early, reducing time lock is held *Another Transaction can start ASAP which is better!*

### Basics of Deadlock Avoidance

Deadlock avoidance is about making sure that your system never gets into a situation where different processes (or threads) are waiting on each other indefinitely. This can happen when each process holds some resources while waiting for others that are held by other processes.

### What is A Priori Information?

"A priori" is a Latin term meaning "from before". In this context, it refers to having some knowledge in advance. In terms of deadlock avoidance, it means the system needs to know in advance about certain things like:
- **Maximum Demand:** How much of each type of resource (like memory, CPU, files) each process might need during its execution.
- **Current State:** How many resources each process is currently using and how many are free.

Having this information in advance helps the system make better decisions about whether to allow a process to use certain resources or make it wait, to avoid getting into a deadlock.

### Deadlock Avoidance Algorithms

To use this information effectively, systems use specific algorithms:

1. **Safe State Algorithm:**
   - This algorithm always keeps the system in a "safe state". A safe state means that there is at least one sequence of action*s (like processes finishing their tasks)* that can occur without leading to a deadlock.
   - The system grants a resource only if doing so will keep the system in a safe state. If not, the process might have to wait, even if the resource is currently available.

2. **Resource-Allocation-Graph Algorithm:**
   - This uses a special graph to represent which resources each process is holding and which it is waiting to acquire.
   - The system maintains this graph and makes sure it never forms a cycle. A cycle in this graph would indicate a potential deadlock where each process in the cycle is waiting for a resource held by the next process in the cycle.

### Summary

In simpler terms, avoiding deadlocks involves the system being a bit like a very cautious traffic controller. It needs to know all the routes (resources) each car (process) will ever need to take before they start their journey. The system uses this info to prevent any possibility of all roads getting blocked (deadlock). The traffic controller only lets cars enter certain parts of the road if it's sure that doing so won't cause a traffic jam that blocks everyone indefinitely.
